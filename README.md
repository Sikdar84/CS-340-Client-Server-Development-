# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I use modular architecture, clear structure, and comments to develop code that is understandable and maintainable. I developed the reusable CRUD Python program animal_shelter.py for Project One in order to manage database activities. This decreased code redundancy and made connecting the Project Two dashboard to MongoDB simpler. The module's adaptability makes it possible to reuse it with little modification in upcoming NoSQL or MongoDB applications.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I address difficulties by understanding requirements, meticulously planning, and thoroughly testing each phase of the project. For Grazioso Salvare, I separated the work into three stages: database setup, CRUD development, and dashboard construction. Using an incremental approach and GitHub version control allowed me to assure accuracy and flexibility. To effectively satisfy the objectives of my clients, I intend to continue employing modular design and testing on future projects.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists develop technologies that solve real-world issues and increase efficiency. My dashboard enables Grazioso Salvare to examine and filter animal data in order to identify rescue canines more quickly. This research demonstrates how software tools aid businesses by transforming data into actionable insights, allowing them to fulfill their goals more efficiently.
